# 1. Why Kondensor?

## Name

The deliberate mispelling makes the project unique and there were plenty of GitHub projects
called "condensor," so unique seemed like a good
thing.

## Belief / Hypothesis

Design patterns
for cloud services (like OO programming before)
can help people reason about and simplify
their systems development and cloud transformation
strategies.

## Project

Designing a good architecture of cloud services
seems difficult enough that a tool should
be created to help people with this.

Cloud services are conceptually difficult,
to some degree, depending on how aware
someone is about the evolution of public cloud
services and that higher-order cloud services
can offer significant operational and cost benefits.

## Compared to existing

Kondensor is about solving systems-level problems
of data transformations, events, integration
in high-level ways using patterns.

[AWS Codestar](https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/features/)
 offers templates for limited compute services
and for a limited selection of programmings languages:

- languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby and PHP
- compute: EC2, Lambda and Elastic Beanstalk

[AWS CloudFormation designer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/working-with-templates-cfn-designer-why.html)
assists the user design and model AWS infrastructure
but this **assumes you know what infrastructure you want.**

The existing AWS tools of Codestar and CF Designer are helpful
but either limit the programming environment or make the user
think at a lower level of the infrastructure.
Kondensor is about the system needs.

## Concept

Node-based design tools have worked fairly well
in [Blender](https://blender.org), providing
a powerful visual formalism for linking data transformations together.

In an API-led development, a lot of a system
architecture is about data transformation and flow.
