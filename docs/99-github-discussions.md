# Discussions

GitHub discussions might help people raise
concerns or get help - this seems useful.

## Use discussions

Let's use Issues for actual problems and this Discussions
feature for questions & answers and to let people
explore or engage.

## What's this for?

GitHub gave some good tips when starting the `Discussions`
feature and they seemed good enough to keep somewhere,
say for contributors or myself :-)

## Those hints from GitHub

### Maintainer tips

The tips, below, came from GitHub, so let's try to use
Discussions this way, until a better idea comes along.

**Thanks GitHub for making awesome new features**
for open source projets.


``` text
For the maintainers, here are some tips 💡 for getting started with Discussions. We'll leave these in Markdown comments for now, but feel free to take out the comments for all maintainers to see.
```

  📢 **Announce to your community** that Discussions is available! Go ahead and send that tweet, post, or link it from the website to drive traffic here.

  🔗 If you use issue templates, **link any relevant issue templates** such as questions and community conversations to Discussions. Declutter your issues by driving community content to where they belong in Discussions. If you need help, here's a [link to the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser).

  ➡️ You can **convert issues to discussions** either individually or bulk by labels. Looking at you, issues labeled “question” or “discussion”.
