# 2. Getting Started

## CDK Needs a working NodeJS

I recommend using NVM - Node Version Manager - to install
NodeJs in a local user directory.

[Go to this page to see how to install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

## Setting up dotnet

On Ubuntu, use dotnet6 (or more recent) by running

`sudo apt install dotnet6`

Then install the AWS CDK library...

`dotnet add package Amazon.CDK.Lib`
